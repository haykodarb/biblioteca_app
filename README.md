# Communal

A semi-decentralized library, made for sharing physical books between members of a community.

A community is thought of as any group of 2 to ~100 people that share location and interests.

It could be for example a group of neighbours, a college class, a reading club, a community center, a group of friends, members of an actual library, etc.

The project is made for those of us who enjoy collecting books but who also wish to share them with the people around them.

Once the book sharing part is complete, I'd like to extend the app towards sharing tools and other physical objects whithin a community, to build a sort of semi-decentralized "maker space", since most of us who like building things usually buy tools that spend most of their time sitting idlely in a storage room.



## Developed With

This project is built using Flutter as the frontend and Supabase as the backend. 

The Flutter App has been and will continue to be fully open source and it's developement will be conducted in this repository.

The Supabase database will be open sourced once I finish building it and figure out how to open source the Postgres database. Ideally I'll build it as a self hostable Docker instance, but it's extra work that I'll do once the project is usable.
