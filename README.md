# Communal

A semi-decentralized library, made for sharing physical books, tools and other items between members of a community.

A community is thought of as any group of 2 to ~100 people that share location and interests.

It could be for example a group of neighbours, a college class, a reading club, a community center, a group of friends, members of an actual library, etc.

The project is made for those of us who enjoy collecting books but who also wish to share them with the people around us.

Sharing is done between members of a community in order to promote sharing between people that know each other IRL and can trust each other with their items. If the community has leaders or organizers they should also be in charge of mediating transactions, inviting new people and kicking out anyone who doesn't follow rules and guidelines.

Once the book sharing part is complete, I'd like to extend the app towards sharing tools and other physical objects whithin a community, to build a sort of semi-decentralized "maker space", since most of us who like building things usually buy tools that spend most of their time sitting idlely in a storage room.



## Developed With

This project is built using Flutter as the frontend and Supabase as the backend. 

The Flutter app has been and will continue to be fully open source and it's developement will be conducted in this repository.

The Supabase database will be open sourced once I finish building it, iron out all backend bugs and exploits with Row Level Security and figure out how to open source the Postgres database. Ideally I'll build it as a self hostable Docker instance, but it's extra work that I'm not willing to do until the project is usable and tested.
